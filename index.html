                Freelance, Cognitant & theEmpire
              </div>
              <p>
                I worked as a freelance web developer for a number of small
                businesses. My main client being
                <a href="https://www.cognitant.com/">Cognitant</a> who I worked
                with from 2019. During this time I was contributing toward
                health VR projects in <b>Unity</b> using <b>C#</b> and their web
                platform
                <a href="https://www.healthinote.com">Healthinote</a> using
                <b>Express.js, Docker and React</b>. Alongside this freelance
                work I was also working as a director of a small web development
                consultancy called
                <a href="https://theempire.netlify.com">theEmpire</a>. At
                theEmpire we created full stack web apps for many clients using
                Node.js, Strapi, Express & React. A few of these web apps have
                been added to the Portfolio section at the bottom of this CV.
                Most of these apps are currently in an "MVP" state ready for
                further funding, development and launch. Whilst working with
                theEmpire I was also developing in the background a web app
                which at the click of a button launched an EC2 on AWS and
                deployed our own custom back end docker container running a pre
                configured instance of strapi (using an IAM you could pass in).
                This tool was used to massively reduce our set up time for new
                projects. Future planned work for the app included adding the
                ability to launch a production environment which was auto scaled
                and load balanced. It was also planned to make use of AWS Spot
                Instances to maximise cost effectiveness.

                application using the <b>Java Spring framework with Maven</b>. I
                also gained valuable testing / load testing experience using
                various test suites.

              <p>
                At Swansea University I studied a large number of languages and
                took part in many software group projects. The main language we
                used at Swansea University was Java, we were also taught C and
                C++ using advanced OOP concepts. Valuable work experience I
                gained at Swansea included working as part of a medium sized
                team to develop a "Skype like app" for the University called
                "Skypertawe". This app was written in Java and built as a
                windows application. Whilst at Swansea I also voluntarily took
                part in a game jam hosted by the University where I created a
                game using Unity in a small time frame.

          <p>
            In my spare time I enjoy working on games in Unity 3d (using C#). I
            have worked on a number of different types of games including but
            not limited to, an RTS town building game, an FPS horror game and a
            maze game making use of procedual generation. For my dissertation in
            my final year of University I extended my RTS game to include an
            intelligent AI "Player" that used genetic algorithms to get better
            and better each time it played. Please take a look at my
            <b>portfolio</b> section to see examples/demos of some projects I
            have worked on.

          <p>
            I enjoy cycling and mountain biking in my spare time and have a
            collection of bikes for every type of terrain!

          <p>
            I enjoy keeping physically ﬁt by regurarly working out in the gym
            and exercising. This includes weight lifting, cycling and swimming.

          <div class="subheading mb-0">Rugby</div>
          <p>
            I have played rugby and been a member of my local rugby team from a
